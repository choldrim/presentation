## computation history

Today, I am here to talk about the computer history. Most of us may know that the first computer was born in 1946 in US.
Actually, the history of computer is not just like that. Today, I will bring you something about computer you might not know.
- (first page) Computer History
    - Okay, let me ask you guys one question? Do you know how the ancient people record and calculate the numbers?
- What is the most original computing device?
    - Fingers (with a fingers photo)
        - using one-to-one counting way with your fingers.
        - but it is not enough, even adding your toes, you have only twenty, it's not enough as well.
        - and we have to use our hand to do other things, so it would keep the number state with our fingers
    - Tally stick
        - Tally stick was a very ancient memory aid device, it used to record and document numbers, quantities, or even some sample messages.
        - It was made of animal bones
    - Abacus
        - The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.
        - Roman abacus
            - The Roman abacus was invented as early as 2400 BC.
        - Chinese abacus, Suanpan
            - The earliest Chinese abacus can be dated to the 2nd century BC.
            - It can do add, subtract, multiply and divide.
            - For a skilled user of abacus be could perform addition and subtraction as fast as the person using an electronic calculator. However, multiplication and division are much slower.
            - The Chinese abacus is just a representation of the human fingers: the 5 lowers rings represent our 5 fingers and the upper tow rings represent both of our hands.
            - And as far as I know, it had been used for calculating numbers for a long time in China. It was common util the electronic calculator was introduced into China. In my memory, when I was in Primary school, the Suanpan course was the compulsory course.
    - Antikythera mechanism
        - It is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer".
        - It was designed to calculate and simulate astronomical positions.
        - It was discovered in 1901 in the Greek island
    - Tide predicting machine
        - Tide predicting machine was invented in 1872, by the famous British mechanical engineer engineer William Thomson.
        - It was beneficial to navigation in shallow waters.
    - Difference Engine(差分机)
        - It was the first mechanical computer, invented by Charles Babbage, who was considered as
        "father of the computer".
        - But it's not convenient for inputing data, and he also realized there was a much more general design can be applied on this machine.
        - So, in 1833, a programmable computer was invented.
    - Analytical Engine
        - The input of programs and data can be provided via punched cards.
        - For output, there must be a printer for this machine, because there was no any screen at that time.
        - However, all the parts for his machine had to be done by hand, this was the biggest problem for a device which contained thousands of parts. It means, while this machine was working, there must be so many tech guys standing by it.
        - Eventually, this project was stopped by the decision of the British Government with cutting off financial support.
    - Torpedo Data Computer
        - In 1938, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer.
        - It's small enough to use aboard a submarine.
        - It's used to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target.
        - During World War II, similar devices were developed in other countries as well.
    - Colossus
        - Colossus was the first electronic digital programmable computing device, and was used to break German ciphers during World War II.
        - It used such a large number of vacuum tubes that .
    - ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
        - It was the first all-electronic programmable computer built in the US for United States Army.
        - It was much faster, more flexible, and it was the first Turing-complete device.
        - It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine at the same period.
        - And it also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root.
        - However, once a program was written, it had to be manually reset via the physical plugs and switches. It means, there must be a lot of operators while this big monster was working.
        - Generally speaking, if someone mentions the first computer was born in 1946, and then, that computer is ENIAC.
        - Without exaggeration, it just like a monster, it occupied such a large place to 167 m2 and consumed 150 KW of electricity. This power requirement was crazy, so that whenever this computer was switched on, the lights of all city were getting dark(dimmed).
    - Transistor was invented

- Make a comparison between the first computer and modern computer

- Types of computer
    - Smartphone
    - Micro computer
    - Personal computer
    - Laptop
    - Minicomputer
