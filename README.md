## computation history

- (first page) Computer History
    - Today, I am here to talk about computer history. Some of you guys maybe know that the first computer was born in 1946 in America.
    - Actually, the history of computer is not just like that. Today, I will bring you something about computer you don't known before.
    - Okay, Before we begin, let me ask you guys one question. Do you know how the ancient people record and calculate the numbers?
    - Lol, you know, in the ancient world, there was no any computer, calculator, pen, or even paper,
    - Okay, let me show you the answer, follow me~
- How to counting the numbers?
    - Fingers (with a fingers photo)
        - using one-to-one counting way with your fingers.
        - but there are two problems, the first one is that it's totally not enough, because we just have ten fingers, even adding your toes, you have only twenty, it's not enough as well.
        - and the second problem is that we can't keep the number state with our fingers for a long time, because we have to use both our hands to do many things.
        - But don't worry, our ancestors were so smart, they found something to record the number instead of hands -- Tally stick
- How to record the numbers?
    - Tally stick
        - Tally stick was one of the oldest memory aid devices.
        - It was made of animal bones and was used to record numbers and some sample messages.
        - As the development of human civilization, those devices are not powerful enough to resolve the complex arithmetic problems.
        - So the smart ancient people invented an amazing and powerful calculating device.
- How to calculate the numbers?
    - Abacus
        - The inventing of abacus was for arithmetic tasks.
        - Roman abacus
            - The Roman abacus is a very old device, it was invented much earlier than the Chinese one.
        - Chinese abacus
            - In China, we call that as Suanpan.
            - The earliest Chinese abacus can be dated to the 2nd century BC.
            - It can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
            - For an abacus skillful user, who can do addition and subtraction as fast as the person who uses electronic calculator. However, multiplication and division are much slower.
            - The Chinese abacus is just a representation of the human fingers: the 5 lower rings represent our 5 fingers and the upper tow rings represent both of our hands.
            - (And as far as I know, it had been used do arithmetic for a long time in China. It was pretty common until the electronic calculator was introduced into China. In my memory, when I was in Primary school, the Suanpan course was the compulsory course.)
    - OKay, let's move to something more mechanical.
- Mechanical generation
    - Antikythera mechanism
        - It's believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer".
        - It was designed to calculate and simulate the astronomical positions.
        - (It was discovered in 1901 in the Greek island)
    - Tide predicting machine
        - Tide predicting machine was invented by the famous British mechanical engineer William Thomson.
        - Look, this ship was hit by rock in shallow water.
        - It was beneficial for sailing navigation in shallow waters.
    - Difference Engine(差分机)
        - It was the first mechanical computer, invented by Charles Babbage, and because of this mechanical machine, Charles Babbage was considered as "father of the computer".
        - But it's not convenient for inputing data, and he also realized there was a much more general design can be applied on this machine.
        - So, in 1833, a programmable computer was invented.
    - Analytical Engine
        - The input of programs and data can be provided via punched cards.
        - For output, there must be a printer for this machine, because there was no any screen at that time.
        - However, all the parts for his machine had to be done by hand, this was the biggest problem for a device which contained thousands of parts. It means, while this machine was working, there must be so many tech guys standing by it.
        - Eventually, this project was stopped by the decision of the British Government with cutting off financial support.
    - Torpedo Data Computer
        - In 1938, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer.
        - It's small enough to use aboard a submarine.
        - It's used to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target.
        - During World War II, similar devices were developed in other countries as well.
- Vacuum tube generation
    - vacuum tube was invented ....
    - Colossus
        - Colossus was the first electronic digital programmable computing device, and was used to break German ciphers during World War II.
        - It used such a large number of vacuum tubes that .
    - ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
        - It was the first all-electronic programmable computer built in the US for United States Army.
        - It was much faster, more flexible, and it was the first Turing-complete device.
        - It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine at the same period.
        - And it also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root.
        - However, once a program was written, it had to be manually reset via the physical plugs and switches. It means, there must be a lot of operators while this big monster was working.
        - Generally speaking, if someone mentions the first computer, that computer is ENIAC.
        - Without exaggeration, it just like a monster, it occupied such a large place to 167 m2 and consumed 150 KW of electricity. This power requirement was crazy, so that whenever this computer was switched on, the lights of all city were getting dark(dimmed).
