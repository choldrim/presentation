## computation history

Today, I am here to talk about the computer history. Most of us know that the first computer was born in 1946 in US.
Actually, the history of computer is not just like that. Today, I will bring you something about computer you might not know.
- (first page) Computer History
    - Okay, let me ask you guys one question? Do you know how the ancient people record and calculate number?
- What is the most original computing device?
    - Fingers (with a fingers photo)
        - using one-to-one counting way with your fingers.
        - but it is not enough, even adding your toes, you have only twenty, it's not enough as well.
        - and we have to use our hand to do other things, so it would keep the number state with our fingers
    - Tally stick
        - Tally stick was a very ancient memory aid device, it used to record and document numbers, quantities, or even some sample messages.
        - It was made of animal bones
    - Abacus
        - The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.
        - Chinese abacus, Suanpan
            - The earliest Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.
            - And as far as I know, it had been used to calculate numbers for a long time since the electronic calculator was introduced into China. In my memory, when I was in Primary school, the Suanpan course was the compulsory course.
        - Roman abacus
            - The Roman abacus was invented as early as 2400 BC.
    - Antikythera mechanism
        - It is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer".
        - It was designed to calculate and simulate astronomical positions.
        - It was discovered in 1901 in the Greek island
    - Tide predicting machine
        - Tide predicting machine was invented in 1872, by the famous British mechanical engineer engineer William Thomson.
        - It was beneficial to navigation in shallow waters.
    - Difference Engine(差分机)
        - It was the first mechanical computer, invented by Charles Babbage, who was considered as
        "father of the computer".
    - Analytical Engine
        - He realized that there were some things can be improved on the old one he had designed.
        - He wanted to make the mechanical computer much more general.
        - So, in 1833, the first programmable computer was invented.
        - The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards.
        - For output, there must be a printer for this machine, because there was no any screen at that time.
        - However, all the parts for his machine had to be made by hand, this was the biggest problem for a
        device which contained thousands of parts.
        - Eventually, this project was stopped by the decision of the British Government with cutting off funds support.
    - Torpedo Data Computer
        - In 1938, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer.
        - It's small enough to use aboard a submarine.
        - It's used to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target.
        - During World War II, similar devices were developed in other countries as well.
    - Colossus
        - Coossus was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer.
        - It used a large number of vacuum tubes.
    - ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
        - It was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US for United States Army.
        - It was much faster, more flexible, and it was the first Turing-complete device.
        - It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine at the same period.
        - And it also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root.
        - However, once a program was written, it had to be manually reset via the physical plugs and switches. It meant there must be a lot of operators while this big monster was working.

- what was computer born for?
    - The computer was not born for entertainment or email but out of calculating the huge numbers.
    - For example, in 1880, the U.S. population had grown so large that it took more than seven years to sort out the U.S. Census results. So, the government tried to find a faster way to get job done.
