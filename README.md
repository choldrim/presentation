- (first page) Computer History
    - Today, I am here to talk about computer history. Some of you guys maybe know that the first computer was born in 1946 in America for United States Army.
    - Actually, the history of computer is not just like that. Today, I will bring you something about computer you haven't known before.
- (warm up) Asking a question
    - Okay, Before we begin, let me ask you guys one question. Do you know how the ancient people calculate and record the numbers?
    - computer? calculator? or alpha go?
    - O..kay, you know, in the ancient world, there was no any computer, calculator, pen, or even paper,
    - Okay, let me show you the answer, follow me~
- How to count the numbers?
    - Fingers (with a fingers photo)
        - I think the most common way is to use one-to-one counting way with your fingers.
        - but there are two problems, the first one is that we can't keep the number state with our fingers for a long time, because we have to use both our hands to do many things.
        - and the second problem is that we just have ten fingers, it's totally not enough, even adding your toes, you have only twenty, it's not enough as well.
        - But don't worry, our ancestors were so smart, they would find something to resolve those problems.
        - Okay, let's see how the ancient people to record the numbers.
- How to record the numbers?
    - Tally stick
        - Tally stick was one of the oldest memory aid devices.
        - It was made of animal bones and was used to record numbers and some sample messages.
        - As the development of human civilization, those devices are not powerful enough to resolve the complex arithmetic problems.
        - So an amazing and powerful calculating device was invented.
- How to calculate the numbers?
    - Abacus
        - The inventing of abacus was for arithmetic tasks.
        - Roman abacus
            - The Roman abacus was invented much earlier than the Chinese one.
        - Chinese abacus
            - In China, we call that as Suanpan.
            - The earliest Chinese abacus can be dated to the 2nd century BC.
            - It can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
            - For an abacus skillful user, who can do addition and subtraction as fast as the person who uses electronic calculator.
            - However, multiplication and division are much slower.
            - Actually, the Chinese abacus is a representation of the human fingers: the 5 lower rings represent our 5 fingers and the upper tow rings represent both of our hands.
    - OKay, let's move to something more mechanical.
- Mechanical generation
    - Tide predicting machine
        - Tide predicting machine was invented by the famous British mechanical engineer William Thomson.
        - It was beneficial for sailing navigation in shallow waters.
        - Look, this ship was hit by rock in shallow water.
    - Difference Engine(差分机)
        - It was the first mechanical computer,
        - But it's not convenient for data input, and he also realized there was a much more general design can be applied on this machine.
        - So, in 1833, a programmable computer was invented.
    - Analytical Engine
        - It was the first mechanical and programmable computer, invented by Charles Babbage, who was considered as "father of the computer".
        - The input of data and programs can be provided via punched cards.
        - For output, there must be a printer for this machine, because there was no screen, projector or any other display devices at that time.
        - However, all the parts of this machine had to be done by hand, this was the biggest problem for a device which contained thousands of parts. In other words, while this machine was working, there must be a lot of operators standing by it.
        - Eventually, as you can see, this project was stopped by the decision of the British Government with cutting off financial support.
        - It seems that everything was over, but in fact, the concept of this machine inspires the next generation computer a lot.
- Vacuum tube generation
    - vacuum tube
        - What is vacuum tube?
        - The vacuum tube is a device to control the electric current from a side to another side.
        - Yeah, it's a electric switch.
        - And it is smaller, more flexible than this mechanical one.
    - ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
        - It was the first all-electronic programmable computer.
        - It was built in 1946 for the United States Army.
        - It could do addition 5000 times in one second, a thousand times faster than any other machine at the same generation.
        - By the way, it just like a monster, it occupied such a large place to 167 m2. And the power requirement was so crazy, whenever it was switched on, the lights of all city were dimmed.
        - Yeah, It's crazy.
- Transistor was invented
    - Transistor was a electronic switch as well, but it's made of silicon.
    - And it's more smaller, lower power consumption.
    - TRADIC
        - TRADIC was not the first transistor computer in the world, but it was the first transistor computer in the USA
        - It was born in the legendary place -- Bell Labs.
        - Yeah, Bell Labs was famous in America.
- Integrated circuit
    - The Integrated circuit is a small chip with large numbers of tiny transistors.
    - There are two main advantages over integrated circuit: cost and performance.
    - Cost is low because a lot of transistors are integrated into a small chip, so that it needs less material.
    - Performance is high because the IC components switch quickly and consume little power.
- Microprocessor
    - xx
- Artificial Intelligence
    - AI is that the human intelligence is shown by the machines.

- Let's review the generations we have mentioned before
- Generation of computer
    - First generation (1946-1957)
        - Vacuum tube
    - Second generation (1957-1964)
        - Transistor
    - Third generation (1964-1971)
        - Integrated circuit
    - Fourth generation (1971-now)
        - Microprocessor
    - Fifth generation (present and beyond)
        - Artificial Intelligence
